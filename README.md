## Exploratory Data Analysis + (Feature Engineering,Dimensionality Reduction)

## The Entire Process of EDA is divided into 3 parts :
### 1] Data Analysis
### 2] Feature Engineering
### 3] Dimensionality Reduction (Feature Selection,Feature extraction)

## Note : This is a general process to perform EDA.Depending on your dataset and task at hand,you may use all or only a few of the steps defined below.

## Exploratory Data Analysis is performed only on structured datasets.These structured datasets have 2 types of features :
### 1] Numerical
### 2] Categorical

## These 2 types of features are again sub-divided into further parts:
### 1] Numerical Variable can be of 2 types : Discrete,Continuous
### 2] Categorical Variable can be of 2 types : Nominal,Ordinal
