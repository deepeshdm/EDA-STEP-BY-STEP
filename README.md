## Exploratory Data Analysis + (Feature Engineering,Dimensionality Reduction)

### The Entire Process of EDA is divided into 3 parts :
### 1] Data Analysis
### 2] Feature Engineering
### 3] Dimensionality Reduction (Feature Selection,Feature Elimination,Feature extraction)

##
### NOTE : This is a general process to perform EDA,depending on your dataset and task at hand,you may use all or only a few of the steps defined below.
##

### Exploratory Data Analysis is performed only on structured datasets.These structured datasets have 2 types of features :
### A) Numerical (of 2 types : Discrete,Continuous)
### B) Categorical (of 2 types : Nominal,Ordinal)
##

# Data Analysis

### Step 1] Variable Identification
